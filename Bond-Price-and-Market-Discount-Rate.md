# Bond Price and Market Discount Rate
- The **market discount rate** is used in the time-value-of-money calculation to obtain the present value.
- The market discount rate is the rate of return required by investors given the risk of the investment in the bond. 
- It is also called the **required yield**, or the **required rate of return**
- The price of a fixed-rate bond will change whenever the market discount rate changes. Four relationships about the change in the bond price given the market discount rate are:
  - The inverse effect
  - The convexity effect
  - The coupon effect
  - The maturity effect
