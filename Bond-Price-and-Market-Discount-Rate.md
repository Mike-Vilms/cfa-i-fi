# Bond Price and Market Discount Rate
- The **market discount rate** is used in the time-value-of-money calculation to obtain the present value.
- The market discount rate is the rate of return required by investors given the risk of the investment in the bond. 
- It is also called the **required yield**, or the **required rate of return**
- The price of a fixed-rate bond will change whenever the market discount rate changes. Four relationships about the change in the bond price given the market discount rate are:
  - The inverse effect
  - The convexity effect
  - The coupon effect
  - The maturity effect

### The inverse effect
- The bond price is inversely related to the market discount rate. When the market discount rate increases, the bond price decreases (the inverse effect)


### The convexity effect
- For the same coupon rate and time-to-maturity, the percentage price change is greater (in absolute value, meaning without regard to the sign of the change) when the market discount rate goes down than when it goes up (the convexity effect)
- For each bond, the percentage price increases are greater in absolute value than the percentage price decreases. This implies that the relationship between bond prices and the market discount rate is not linear; instead, it is curved. It is described as being “convex.”

### The coupon effect
- For the same time-to-maturity, a lower-coupon bond has a greater percentage price change than a higher-coupon bond when their market discount rates change by the same amount (the coupon effect)



### The maturity effect
- Generally, for the same coupon rate, a longer-term bond has a greater percentage price change than a shorter-term bond when their market discount rates change by the same amount (the maturity effect)
