# Primary and Secondary Bond Markets
- Primary bond markets are markets in which issuers initially sell bonds to investors to raise capital. 
- In contrast, secondary bond markets are markets in which existing bonds are subsequently traded among investors.

## Primary Markets
- A bond issue can be sold via a public offering (or public offer), in which any member of the public may buy the bonds, or via a private placement, in which only a selected investor, or group of investors, may buy the bonds.
- The most common bond issuing mechanisms are 
  - Underwritten offerings
  - Best effort offerings 
  - Auctions

### Underwritten Offerings
- In an underwritten offering, also called a firm commitment offering, the investment bank guarantees the sale of the bond issue at an offering price that is negotiated with the issuer
- Thus, the investment bank, called the underwriter, takes the risk associated with selling the bonds
- The underwriting process typically includes six phases
  1. The issuer must determine how much money must be raised, the type of bond offering, and whether the bond issue should be underwritten
  2. Once the issuer has decided that the bond issue should be underwritten, it must select the underwriter, which is typically an investment bank. 
    - The underwriter of a bond issue takes the risk of buying the newly issued bonds from the issuer, and then resells them to investors or to dealers who then sell them to investors. The difference between the purchase price of the new bond issue and the reselling price to investors is the **underwriter’s revenue**. 
  3. Structuring the transaction
    -  Before the bond issue is announced, the issuer and the lead underwriter discuss the terms of the bond issue, such as the bond’s notional principal (total amount), the coupon rate, and the expected offering price
    -  Underwriter typically organizes the necessary regulatory filings and prepares the offering circular or prospectus that provides information about the terms of the bond issue
    -  The **announcement** specifies the new bond issue’s terms and conditions, including the bond’s features, such as the maturity date, the currency denomination, and the expected coupon range, as well as the expected offering price
  4. Between the **announcement** of a bond issue and the **end of the subscription period**, the underwriter must gauge what the demand for the bond issue is and at what price the bond should be offered to ensure that the entire bond issue is placed without running the risk of a large oversubscription
  5. **Pricing day** is the last day when investors can commit to buy the bond issue
    - The following day, called the “**offering day**”, the underwriting agreement that includes the bond issue’s final terms is signed
    - The underwriting process then enters the issuing phase
    - The underwriter purchases the entire bond issue from the issuer, delivers the proceeds, and starts reselling the bonds through its sales network
  6. The underwriting process comes to an end about 14 days later, on the **closing day**, when the bonds are delivered to investors
