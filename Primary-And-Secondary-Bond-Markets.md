# Primary and Secondary Bond Markets
- Primary bond markets are markets in which issuers initially sell bonds to investors to raise capital. 
- In contrast, secondary bond markets are markets in which existing bonds are subsequently traded among investors.

## Primary Markets
- A bond issue can be sold via a public offering (or public offer), in which any member of the public may buy the bonds, or via a private placement, in which only a selected investor, or group of investors, may buy the bonds.
- The most common bond issuing mechanisms are 
  - Underwritten offerings
  - Best effort offerings 
  - Auctions

### Underwritten Offerings
- In an underwritten offering, also called a firm commitment offering, the investment bank guarantees the sale of the bond issue at an offering price that is negotiated with the issuer
- Thus, the investment bank, called the underwriter, takes the risk associated with selling the bonds
- The underwriting process typically includes six phases
  1. The issuer must determine how much money must be raised, the type of bond offering, and whether the bond issue should be underwritten
  2. Once the issuer has decided that the bond issue should be underwritten, it must select the underwriter, which is typically an investment bank. 
    - The underwriter of a bond issue takes the risk of buying the newly issued bonds from the issuer, and then resells them to investors or to dealers who then sell them to investors. The difference between the purchase price of the new bond issue and the reselling price to investors is the **underwriterâ€™s revenue**.
