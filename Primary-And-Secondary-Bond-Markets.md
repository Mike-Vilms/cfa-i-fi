# Primary and Secondary Bond Markets
- Primary bond markets are markets in which issuers initially sell bonds to investors to raise capital. 
- In contrast, secondary bond markets are markets in which existing bonds are subsequently traded among investors.

## Primary Markets
- A bond issue can be sold via a public offering (or public offer), in which any member of the public may buy the bonds, or via a private placement, in which only a selected investor, or group of investors, may buy the bonds.
