## Bond Indenture
- The **trust deed** is the legal contract that describes the form of the bond, the obligations of the issuer, and the rights of the bondholders.
- Market participants frequently call this legal contract the **bond indenture**, particularly in the United States and Canada

### ```Legal Identity of the Bond Issuer and its Legal Form```
- The legal obligation to make the contractual payments is assigned to the bond issuer. 
- The legal issuer may be different from the body that administers the bond issue process.
  - Using the UK example, the legal obligation to repay gilts lies with HM Treasury, but the bonds are issued by the UK Debt Management Office, an executive agency of HM Treasury
- For corporate bonds, the issuer is usually the corporate legal entityâ€”for example, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., or Volkswagen AG
- However, bonds are sometimes issued by a subsidiary of a parent legal entity. 
  - In this case, investors should look at the credit quality of the subsidiary, unless the indenture specifies that the bond liabilities are guaranteed by the parent.
- For ABS, the legal obligation to repay the bondholders often lies with the special legal entity that was created by the financial institution in charge of the securitization process
  - The financial institution is known as the sponsor or originator. 
  - The special legal entity is most frequently referred to as a special purpose entity (SPE) in the United States and a special purpose vehicle (SPV) in Europe
