## Bond Indenture
- The **trust deed** is the legal contract that describes the form of the bond, the obligations of the issuer, and the rights of the bondholders.
- Market participants frequently call this legal contract the **bond indenture**, particularly in the United States and Canada

### ```Legal Identity of the Bond Issuer and its Legal Form```
- The legal obligation to make the contractual payments is assigned to the bond issuer. 
- The legal issuer may be different from the body that administers the bond issue process.
  - Using the UK example, the legal obligation to repay gilts lies with HM Treasury, but the bonds are issued by the UK Debt Management Office, an executive agency of HM Treasury
- For corporate bonds, the issuer is usually the corporate legal entity—for example, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., or Volkswagen AG
- However, bonds are sometimes issued by a subsidiary of a parent legal entity. 
  - In this case, investors should look at the credit quality of the subsidiary, unless the indenture specifies that the bond liabilities are guaranteed by the parent.
- For ABS, the legal obligation to repay the bondholders often lies with the special legal entity that was created by the financial institution in charge of the securitization process
  - The financial institution is known as the sponsor or originator. 
  - The special legal entity is most frequently referred to as a special purpose entity (SPE) in the United States and a special purpose vehicle (SPV) in Europe

### ```Source of Repayment Proceeds```
- **Sovereign bonds** are backed by the “full faith and credit” of the national government and thus by that government’s ability to raise tax revenues and print money
  - Sovereign bonds denominated in local currency are generally considered the safest of all investments because governments have the power to raise taxes to make interest payments and principal repayments
  - Thus, it is highly probable that interest and principal will be paid fully and on time
  - As a consequence, the yields on sovereign bonds are typically lower than those for otherwise similar bonds from other local issuers
- There are three major sources for repayment of **non-sovereign government debt issues**, and bonds are usually classified according to these sources:
  - The first source is through the general taxing authority of the issuer
  - The second source is from the cash flows of the project the bond issue is financing
  - The third source is from special taxes or fees established specifically for the purpose of funding interest payments and principal repayments
- The source of payment for **corporate bonds** is the issuer’s ability to generate cash flows, primarily through its operations
- Source of payment for ABS does not depend on the claims-paying ability of an operating entity but on the cash flows generated by one or more underlying financial assets, such as mortgages or auto loans. 
  - Thus, investors in ABS must pay special attention to the quality of the assets backing the ABS.

### ```Asset or Collateral Backing```
- **Collateral trust bonds** are secured by securities such as common shares, other bonds, or other financial assets. 
  - These securities are pledged by the issuer and typically held by the trustee.
- **Equipment trust certificates** are bonds secured by specific types of equipment or physical assets, such as aircraft, railroad cars, shipping containers, or oil rigs
  - *Example*:
    - Airline finances the purchase of new aircraft with equipment trust certificates  
    - The legal title to the aircraft is held by the trustee, which issues equipment trust certificates to investors in the amount of the aircraft purchase price
    - The trustee leases the aircraft to the airline and collects lease payments from the airline to pay the interest on the certificates
    - When the certificates mature, the trustee sells the aircraft to the airline, uses the proceeds to retire the principal, and cancels the lease
- A **covered bond** is a debt obligation backed by a segregated pool of assets called a “cover pool”. 

##  Legal and Regulatory Considerations

## Structure of a Bond’s cash flows
- **Plain vanilla bond**: make periodic, fixed coupon payments and a lump-sum payment of principal at maturity
  - Such a bond is also known as a bullet bond because the entire payment of principal occurs at maturity
- **Amortizing bond**: has a payment schedule that calls for periodic payments of interest and repayments of principal
  - A bond that is fully amortized is characterized by a fixed periodic payment schedule that reduces the bond’s outstanding principal amount to zero by the maturity date
- **Partially amortized bond**: also makes fixed periodic payments until maturity, but only a portion of the principal is repaid by the maturity date. 
  - Thus, a balloon payment is required at maturity to retire the bond’s outstanding principal amount
