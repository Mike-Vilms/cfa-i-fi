## Bond Indenture
- The **trust deed** is the legal contract that describes the form of the bond, the obligations of the issuer, and the rights of the bondholders.
- Market participants frequently call this legal contract the **bond indenture**, particularly in the United States and Canada

### ```Legal Identity of the Bond Issuer and its Legal Form```
- The legal obligation to make the contractual payments is assigned to the bond issuer. 
- The legal issuer may be different from the body that administers the bond issue process.
  - Using the UK example, the legal obligation to repay gilts lies with HM Treasury, but the bonds are issued by the UK Debt Management Office, an executive agency of HM Treasury
- For corporate bonds, the issuer is usually the corporate legal entity—for example, Wal-Mart Stores Inc., Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd., or Volkswagen AG
- However, bonds are sometimes issued by a subsidiary of a parent legal entity. 
  - In this case, investors should look at the credit quality of the subsidiary, unless the indenture specifies that the bond liabilities are guaranteed by the parent.
- For ABS, the legal obligation to repay the bondholders often lies with the special legal entity that was created by the financial institution in charge of the securitization process
  - The financial institution is known as the sponsor or originator. 
  - The special legal entity is most frequently referred to as a special purpose entity (SPE) in the United States and a special purpose vehicle (SPV) in Europe

### ```Source of Repayment Proceeds```
- **Sovereign bonds** are backed by the “full faith and credit” of the national government and thus by that government’s ability to raise tax revenues and print money
  - Sovereign bonds denominated in local currency are generally considered the safest of all investments because governments have the power to raise taxes to make interest payments and principal repayments
  - Thus, it is highly probable that interest and principal will be paid fully and on time
  - As a consequence, the yields on sovereign bonds are typically lower than those for otherwise similar bonds from other local issuers
- There are three major sources for repayment of **non-sovereign government debt issues**, and bonds are usually classified according to these sources:
  - The first source is through the general taxing authority of the issuer
  - The second source is from the cash flows of the project the bond issue is financing
  - The third source is from special taxes or fees established specifically for the purpose of funding interest payments and principal repayments
- The source of payment for **corporate bonds** is the issuer’s ability to generate cash flows, primarily through its operations
- Source of payment for ABS does not depend on the claims-paying ability of an operating entity but on the cash flows generated by one or more underlying financial assets, such as mortgages or auto loans. 
  - Thus, investors in ABS must pay special attention to the quality of the assets backing the ABS.
